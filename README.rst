How-To Document Data Science Projects with Microsoft Azure
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This project is part of a blog article published at `Medium`_.
We will give you a step by step guide on documenting your Python data
science project effectively as a part of machine learning model development.
The solution we propose ensures that your documentation is version
controlled, made available to your users or co-workers and shipped with the
source code executing your machine learning experiment. We will use generally
available tools including sphinx, GitHub, Microsoft Azure DevOps, and Azure
storage or Azure web Services.

Problem Statement
=================

The problem statement of the Modified National Institute of Standards and
Technology database (MNIST) dataset is a large database of handwritten digits.
It is widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.
It is a classification problem with 10 classes that aims to train a machine
learning model to correctly classify handwritten digits. The MNIST
classification problem has developed into a popular example for introductory
machine learning tutorials. An extensive list of successfully trained machine
learning models can be found at the MNIST `website`_ of Yann LeCunn.

The Data Set
============

The MNIST dataset was created by combining samples from MINST's original datasets.
